Within the game it is possible to play in single player or in two players. 
It is possible to save an unfinished game and resume it later by loading the save file.

To play the video game just run the command: 
  To compile: javac con4\consoleGame\Main.java 
  Tu run: java con4\consoleGame\Main 
  
To load a valid save file just use the --load [path_to_file] option.
To enable colors in the program, just add the --color option.
